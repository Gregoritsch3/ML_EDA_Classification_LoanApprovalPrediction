# ML_EDA_Classification_LoanApprovalPrediction
An EDA and Machine Learning Classification exercise on the Loan Approval dataset demonstrating EDA, feature engineering, StratifiedKFold and the use of Tensorflow NN, SVC, LinearSVC, XGBoost, Naive-Bayes, Bagging, Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms, etc. The models are optimized using hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV and finally evaluated on the test set.
